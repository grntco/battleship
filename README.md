# Battleship

This is a project for The Odin Project's (TOP) JavaScript course [to create a battleship game](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship) to practice unit testing.

I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Jest, and webpack.

This is the first major project I implemented unit testing on. I learned which methods to test, how to use mocking, and how to organize my tests with test suites. 

Testing aside, I also implemented much of what I learned throughout TOP's JavaScript course in this final project, including building the project with webpack and JS modules.
